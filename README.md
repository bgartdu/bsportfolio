* for this project I created a Functional, deployed portfolio page

* I created a GitHub repository with README describing this project

* Navbar is consistent on each page and contains links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

* All links work.

* I used semantic html.

* I used a validator to cheack the html.  https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fbgartdu.github.io%2FEach

* The site contains my bio, name, images, and links to social media.

* I used Bootstrap components and grid system.

* I learned a lot doing this project, I worked with a tutor but was able to complete more on my own.  I struggled with the contact page to be layed out better.  I know that my bio is short and am looking forward to adding more to it in the future.
